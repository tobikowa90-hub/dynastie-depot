- Terminal Rate < WACC (must be true, otherwise invalid)

**Step 3: Cross-Validate**
- get_stock_ttm_pe / get_industry_ttm_pe (compare P/E implied by DCF vs current/industry)
- If DCF suggests 50%+ undervaluation but multiples at highs → revisit assumptions

**Step 4: Generate Professional DCF Report**

### Extraction Rules

**For amount fields** (revenue, income, cash, etc.):
- Extract the number exactly as spoken (do NOT scale it yourself)
- Record the unit as spoken: `trillion`, `billion`, `million`, `thousand`, or `per_share` for EPS metrics
- Record `currency_code` (e.g., USD, CNY, EUR)
- If a range is given (e.g., "$3.5B to $4.0B"), use the **midpoint** (3.75B)
- Example: "revenue of $25.7 billion" → value=25.7, unit=billion, currency=USD

**For percentage fields** (margins):
- Extract the percentage value as a number (e.g., 72.5 for "72.5%")
- unit is always `%`
- If a range is given, use the midpoint

**For null fields**:
- If a metric is not mentioned anywhere in the transcript → mark as `null` / "N/A"
- Do NOT infer or estimate values that were not explicitly stated

**Source tracing**:
- Always record `paragraph_number` where the data appeared
- Always record `speaker` (e.g., "CFO", "CEO", "John Smith")

---

### Output Format

Present results in three grouped tables:

**Table 1 — This Quarter Results (FY{year} Q{quarter})**

   → If user said "latest", use the first (most recent) entry

2. get_stock_earning_call_transcript(symbol, fiscal_year, fiscal_quarter)
   → Retrieve full transcript paragraphs

3. Scan every sentence in every paragraph
   → For each sentence: does it explicitly describe a financial metric
     that changed vs prior quarter (QoQ) or same quarter last year (YoY)?
   → If yes → extract per the schema below
   → If no  → skip

4. Filter: keep only factual sentences (is_factual = Y)
   → Discard any sentence that is a projection, guidance, expectation, or forecast

5. Output structured result table (see Output Format below)
```

### Extraction Schema

For each qualifying sentence, extract all of the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sentence` | string | The exact sentence from the transcript. It MUST explicitly describe a financial metric that changed vs prior quarter (QoQ) or same quarter last year (YoY). Do not paraphrase. |
| `speaker` | string | Name or role of the speaker (e.g., "CFO", "CEO", "Jane Smith") |
| `paragraph_number` | integer | Paragraph number in the transcript where this sentence appears |
| `is_factual` | Y / N | **Y** = the change already occurred (factual result). **N** = projection, guidance, expectation, or forecast. Only keep Y rows in the final output. |
| `short_summary` | string | One short phrase summarizing the metric change (e.g., "Revenue up 12% YoY", "Gross margin declined QoQ") |
| `direction` | up / down / unchanged | Direction of the change inferred from the sentence |
| `reason` | string | The reason behind the change, using management's own wording from the transcript. Empty string if no reason is mentioned. |

---

### Extraction Rules

**What qualifies as a "financial metric change" sentence**:
- Must mention a specific financial metric (revenue, gross margin, operating income, EPS, FCF, headcount, units shipped, etc.)
- Must describe a change relative to a prior period: QoQ (sequential, prior quarter, last quarter) or YoY (year-over-year, same quarter last year, prior year)
- Quantitative comparisons preferred, but qualitative directional statements also qualify (e.g., "margins expanded significantly compared to last year")

**What does NOT qualify**:
- Forward-looking statements, guidance, outlook, expectations ("we expect revenue to grow…")
- General business descriptions without a comparison period
- Sentences that mention a metric level but no change vs a prior period

**is_factual determination**:
- Y: the change is described as having already happened ("revenue grew", "margin expanded", "we achieved")
- N: future tense, conditional, or hedged language ("we expect", "we anticipate", "guidance is", "we target")
- When in doubt, lean toward N

**Direction**:
- `up`: metric increased, grew, expanded, improved, rose
- `down`: metric decreased, declined, contracted, fell, dropped
- `unchanged`: metric was flat, stable, in line with prior period

---

### Output Format

Present results as a single table, sorted by `paragraph_number`:

**Financial Metric Changes — FY{year} Q{quarter} (Factual, QoQ/YoY)**

| # | Summary | Direction | Speaker | Para# | Sentence | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Revenue up 12% YoY | ⬆️ up | CFO | 12 | "Our revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $25.7 billion." | Strong demand in cloud segment |
| 2 | Gross margin declined QoQ | ⬇️ down | CFO | 14 | "Gross margin came in at 71.2%, down from 73.1% last quarter." | Higher component costs |
| 3 | Operating income flat YoY | ➡️ unchanged | CEO | 18 | "Operating income was essentially flat compared to the same period last year." | |

**Direction indicators**: ⬆️ up · ⬇️ down · ➡️ unchanged

After the table, add a brief summary:
- Total changes found: N (up: X, down: Y, unchanged: Z)
- Key themes (1–3 bullet points highlighting the most significant changes)

## Template 13: Analyze Financial Metric Forecasts from Earnings Call

**Use case**: Extract every sentence from an earnings call transcript that contains specific numerical forward-looking statements — guidance, outlook, expectations, or forecasts for future periods. Infer management's attitude (optimistic / pessimistic / neutral) for each. No external LLM needed; Claude performs the extraction.

---

### Workflow

```
1. get_stock_earning_call_transcripts_list(symbol)
   → Identify target fiscal_year and fiscal_quarter
   → If user said "latest", use the first (most recent) entry

2. get_stock_earning_call_transcript(symbol, fiscal_year, fiscal_quarter)
   → Retrieve full transcript paragraphs

3. Scan every sentence in every paragraph
   → For each sentence: does it contain specific numerical figures AND
     describe a projection, guidance, outlook, expectation, or forecast
     for a future period?
   → If yes → extract per the schema below
   → If no  → skip

4. Output structured result table (see Output Format below)
```

### Extraction Schema

For each qualifying sentence, extract all of the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sentence` | string | The exact sentence from the transcript. It MUST contain specific numerical figures (percentages, basis points, or monetary amounts) AND be forward-looking (projection, guidance, outlook, expectation, or forecast). Do not paraphrase. |
| `speaker` | string | Name or role of the speaker (e.g., "CFO", "CEO", "Jane Smith") |
| `paragraph_number` | integer | Paragraph number in the transcript where this sentence appears |
| `short_summary` | string | One short phrase summarizing the forecast (e.g., "Q2 revenue guidance $26–27B", "Full-year gross margin expected ~72%") |
| `attitude` | optimistic / pessimistic / neutral | Management's implied attitude toward this forecast, inferred from tone, context, and comparison to prior periods |
| `reason` | string | The reason or driver behind this forecast, using management's own wording from the transcript. Empty string if no reason is mentioned. |

### Extraction Rules

**What qualifies as a "forecast" sentence**:
- Must contain specific numerical figures: a dollar amount, percentage, basis points, unit count, or EPS value
- Must be forward-looking: future tense or language like "we expect", "we anticipate", "guidance is", "we project", "we target", "we are on track to", "outlook is"
- Covers any future time horizon: next quarter, full fiscal year, next few years, long-term targets

**What does NOT qualify**:
- Factual past results, even if they contain numbers ("revenue was $25.7B last quarter")
- Vague forward-looking statements without specific numbers ("we remain optimistic about growth")
- Restatements of already-reported figures

**Attitude determination**:
- `optimistic`: management signals confidence, improvement, acceleration, or beats ("we are well-positioned", "we expect strong growth", "ahead of our targets")
- `pessimistic`: management signals concern, deceleration, headwinds, or misses ("we expect pressure", "macro headwinds", "below prior guidance")
- `neutral`: matter-of-fact guidance without clear positive or negative signal, or guidance that is in line with prior expectations

**When in doubt on attitude**: use `neutral`

---

### Output Format

Present results as a single table, sorted by `paragraph_number`:

**Financial Metric Forecasts — FY{year} Q{quarter}**

| # | Summary | Attitude | Speaker | Para# | Sentence | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Q2 revenue guidance $26–27B | 😊 optimistic | CEO | 34 | "We expect revenue in the range of $26 to $27 billion for the next quarter." | Continued cloud demand and strong pipeline |
| 2 | Full-year gross margin ~72% | 😐 neutral | CFO | 38 | "We anticipate full-year non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 72%." | |
| 3 | Q2 operating margin under pressure | 😟 pessimistic | CFO | 41 | "We expect operating margin to decline by roughly 200 basis points sequentially due to increased R&D investment." | Planned headcount additions and infrastructure spend |

**Attitude indicators**: 😊 optimistic · 😐 neutral · 😟 pessimistic

After the table, add a brief summary:
- Total forecasts found: N (optimistic: X, neutral: Y, pessimistic: Z)
- Overall management tone: [one sentence characterizing the dominant attitude]
- Key themes (1–3 bullet points on the most significant forward-looking items)
